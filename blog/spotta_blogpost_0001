This marks the very first Spotta.co devlog entry! To kick things off, let's start with a brief de
scription of the project then move on to more technical details and what I'm currently working on
.
Spotta is a not-so-spiritual successor to the Facebook-based pages of "Spotted at <UNIVERSITY>".
For those unfamiliar with the idea of spotted@x, here's the gist of it in terms of the Facebook-based implementations: 
1. Student A sees something funny, strange, upsetting, uplifting, destressing, important, etc. at or around school.<br/>2. Student A sends a message to the maintainer of the Facebook page.<br/>3. The maintainer (typically anonymous) hand moderates the message and decides whether the tone and content are appropriate in a non-transparent way.<br />4a. The approved message is then reposted by hand to the group by the maintainer to preserve the anonymity of Student A.<br/>4b. The denied message disappears into oblivion and no feedback is given to Student as to the reason it was rejected.
Without feedback, automated filtering, or even so much as a posting guideline Student A is left to determine the reason his post was rejected by what made it through the sieve. Low hanging fruit like advertising and hate speech need to be filtered out, but a very large grey area exists between acceptable and not. Student A deserves better than to be judged by the shadowy figure behind <a href="https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/1375749_636008586430296_82229446_n.png?oh=ae5277bf1d1d562d59acd7ab0b552ad8&oe=54ACE23D">the raven</a>. 
Students love their Spotted@s and often browse other schools' Spotted pages to get a view into a similar, yet subtly different world of another school's students. The kind of atmosphere created by spotted pages is one of community and mutual understanding. It is often lighthearted and cute with lots of stories of infatuation and missed connections but at the other times heavy and serious as an outlet for the real issues that students face daily. Spotted pages have far greater reach than any on-campus rally or demonstation and&em;almost miraculously&em;give a voice to those who don't have the resources or confidence to rally or hand out pamphlets. In most cases, spotted pages serve as an hub for student humour and that idea is here to stay. The 

 What worries me most about the Facebook-based implementation is a lack of privacy for Student A because their full name exposed immediately to the maintainer upon post submission.

Obviously, there is a TON of opportunity for improvement on this process and future posts will detail those things in more detail.
